"""PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.
IMPORTANT: you may change 3 lines at most.You cannot add or remove lines of code."""

#Answer would be easier with: a = a[:len(a)//2] + a[len(a):len(a)//2-1:-1], buuuuut here it goes:

def findZigZagSequence(a, n):
    a.sort()
    mid = int(n/2) #eliminated the +1, gives the wrong index. Eliminated the extra parentesis
    a[mid], a[n-1] = a[n-1], a[mid]

    st = mid + 1
    ed = n - 2 #it is actually -2, instead of -1. -1 was already changed in line 9
    while (st <= ed):
        a[st], a[ed] = a[ed], a[st]
        st = st + 1
        ed = ed - 1 #it was + when it should be -

    for i in range(n):
        if i == n-1:
            print(a[i])
        else:
            print(a[i], end=' ')
    return
