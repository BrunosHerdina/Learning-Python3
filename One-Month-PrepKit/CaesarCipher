"""PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. 
Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. 
If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. 
In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c."""
